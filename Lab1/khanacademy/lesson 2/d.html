    <p id="design">
      The level design of Mirage follows the traditional square design of Counter-Strike maps such as Dust II, Cache, and Inferno.It is built around a Middle East-inspired town, which contains a number of different buildings and structures, such as apartment buildings, fortresses, stores, and courtyards. Mirage is structured similarly to other bomb defusal maps like Dust II, featuring two bombsites with two main entrances from either spawn, linked to a "mid" area with connecting pathways.
